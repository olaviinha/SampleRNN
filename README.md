# SampleRNN  

This is an ever so slightly modified version of [Tensorflow implementation of SampleRNN](https://github.com/Unisound/SampleRNN) to be run in Google Colab. You're probably better off with [the original repository](https://github.com/Unisound/SampleRNN) (see for details & manual).

## Modifications

- Added `--output_dir` argument, allowing you to specify a path where generated WAV files are saved. 
- 44.1 kHz sample rate
